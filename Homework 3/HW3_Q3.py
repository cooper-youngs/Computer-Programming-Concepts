"""The dot product of two vectors a and b is given by Pni a ib i. Note that we can simply represent a vector as a list. 
Write a computer program which reads in a list of two integers (each list input is given on a separate line). 
If the lengths of the two lists are different, print IMPOSSIBLE. Otherwise, print out the correct dot product. 
Note that if you would like guidance on this problem, you should come to my office hours.
It might seem hard since it uses linear algebra but itâ€™s actually a quite easy problem. 
Note also that you can use the len() function to check that the lengths of the list are the same initially."""
